/** Very simple interface used to short, or transport a pass code for
 *  some object. Most likely the object the code is used for is a machine
 *  and the same item caries location data for the machine. The idea behind
 *  this is to prevent location data from being the only factor in linking
 *  devices. As this can lead to users hacking that data with a machines XYZ.
 *
 *  Designed to be used with {@link IWorldPosItem}
 *          as a dual authentication system for linking machines
