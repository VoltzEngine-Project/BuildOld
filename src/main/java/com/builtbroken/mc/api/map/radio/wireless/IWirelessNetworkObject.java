 * An object that is attached to the wireless network to provide or receive data.

 * The object normally is not {@link IRadioWaveReceiver} or {@link IRadioWaveSender} but is attached to either to supply information. Think
 * of this like a computer attached to a wireless card. The card itself is the sender/receiver and the computer is the wireless object.
 * <p>
 * If a device is a sender or receiver then it shouldn't implement this interface. As this is only used to pass information threw
 * senders and receivers without calling {@link IRadioWaveSender#sendRadioMessage(float, String, Object...)}
 * to save on performance.
