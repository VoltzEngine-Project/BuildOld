/**
 * Used to handle a more complex recipe than input -> output. For example adding NBT or processing
 * item's NBT. Can also be used for standard recipe and intercepting standard recipes.
 * <p/>
 * As for the generic you can default to Object, of Object[] if you want. The recipe handler if
 * created by the voltz engine will handle arrays if needed. Though at the end the generic is
 * mainly for your own use rather than ours. As it will not exist during run time or when
 * registered with the handler. So use it just to make your life simpler.
