# VoltzEngine-API
External repo from the main VoltzEngine repo to help implement the API in other projects easier

### How to implement
Submodule this entire repo as 'src/main/scala/com/builtbroken/mc/api' or 'src/api/scala/com/builtbroken/mc/api'

You will also need this https://github.com/DarkGuardsman/CodingLib as the API depends on several interfaces from that repo. Which does come with a maven for gradle build scripts http://ci.builtbroken.com/maven/com/builtbroken/codinglib/CodingLib/
